# Introduction
This is a mobile app designed to encourage colleagues to attend meetings on time.

# Getting Started
1. Whenever anyone on your team is late to a scheduled meeting, they owe a flat fee of $1-$5 to the team.
2. Once there is enough money collected, decide how you want to spend it (e.g Team Lunch). Everyone simply pays what they owe!
3. Reset and repeat!
